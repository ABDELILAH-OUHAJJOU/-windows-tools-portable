This setup is not completely unattended (service restarts... I'm working on it).

To immediately get started and execute the full upgrade paste this into terminal as root:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmrestivo/linux-system-setup/main/start.sh && chmod 777 start.sh && ./start.sh

to normally install download and inspect the file before executing (reccomended best practice):
git clone https://github.com/ryanmrestivo/linux-system-setup.git
To run -- sudo chmod 777 start.sh && ./start.sh
