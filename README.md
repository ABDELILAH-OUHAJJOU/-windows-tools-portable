These tools are my personal collection of free (and/or) open-source software. Most tools here are portable, which can be useful for when you are out-and-about. Obviously dedicated lab use of tools is ideal, but we don't live in an ideal world.

Use of any of these tools binds you to their TOS/TOU/Licenses.  I am not managing any of the licenses for tools within this repository!

I am currently adding information to validate hashes/sources for each of these tools.
Please do your due dilligance before running pre-compiled binaries you find on the internet!
