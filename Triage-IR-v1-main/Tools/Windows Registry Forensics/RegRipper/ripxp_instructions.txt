These are the instructions for installing and running ripXP:

Installing
RipXP uses all of the same plugins available with RegRipper, so simply 
extract the files in this archive into the same directory with RegRipper
(rr.exe) and rip (rip.exe). 

Running
1.  Using your tool-of-choice (I use FTK Imager), open the image and
extract the hive files you're interested in from the system32\config
directory, as well as from user profile(s), into a directory (ie, 
D:\cases\case001\xp\config).

2.  Using that same tool, within the image navigate to the directory
where the Restore Point directories are located (usually C:\System 
Volume Information\{GUID}\).  Extract all of the RP* directories 
into a directory on your analysis system (ie, D:\cases\case001\xp\restore).

3.  To see the options used by ripXP, simply type:

C:\ripXP>ripxp

RipXP allows you to run one plugin across a designated hive file, and
all corresponding hive files in the Restore Point directories.

C:\ripXP>ripxp -r d:\case\config\ntuser.dat -d d:\case\restore -p userassist
