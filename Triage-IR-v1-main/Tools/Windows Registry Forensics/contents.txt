The software and code on this DVD is provided in support of the "Windows
Registry Forensics" book.  

This DVD contains four directories, each of which is described as follows:

RegRipper
------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the RegRipper suite of tools, to include rip and ripxp, 
as well as instructions as to their use.  For the tools, a Perl script is 
provided along with a "compiled" Windows executable version of each script.
You can run the tools from the DVD, or you can copy them to your system.  To 
run the Windows executables, you need to be sure to have the p2x588.dll in the
same directory as the .exe file.  The best approach is to just copy all of the 
files to another location.

This directory also contains the Plugin Browser tool discussed in chapter 2
of the book.

The use of all of the included tools is described in chapter 2 of the book.

RegSlack
------------------------------------------------------------
Jolanta Thomassen's regslack tool for retrieving unallocated space from a
hive file.  Too use the tool, type a command such as:

C:\tools>regslack d:\cases\case2\system > d:\cases\case2\system_slack.txt

If you meet Jolanta, thank her for her efforts with this tool.  Or email her
at jolantathomassen@hotmail.com.

Maclookup
------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the maclookup.pl Perl script.  Unfortunately, I ran
into considerable difficulty trying to "compile" the code into a Windows 
executable with Perl2Exe, due to module dependencies.  As such, I opted to
leave the code as is...but running it on any system that supports Perl is
fairly trivial.  With Perl installed (for Windows, I use ActiveState's 
ActivePerl, version 5.8.8), be sure that you have the appropriate modules
installed (review the script, or the readme.txt from this directory).

Regscan
------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains RegScan, which is a command line tool meant to be 
run on a live system.  This tool is described in chapter 2 of the book, 
and can be copied from the DVD and run from another location. 

Running regscan from a command prompt will extract information from the
system you're currently logged into; to save the information, use a 
command similar to the following:

C:\tools>regscan > regscan.txt

..or..

C:\tools>regscan > %COMPUTERNAME%_regscan.txt

As with the other tools, be sure that you keep the p2x588.dll file in the
same directory as the EXE file.

Grab
------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains a tool I wrote to use with either an acquired image
mounted with ImDisk, or with F-Response.  This tool can be run to automate the
collection of files from a system or image, as part of incident response or
triage activities.

To see how to run this tool, simply navigate to the directory at the command
prompt and type "grab"; the syntax information will be displayed.

As with the other tools, be sure that you keep the p2x588.dll file in the
same directory as the EXE file.

All of the software is released AS-IS, with no statements or guarantees as to 
its effectiveness or stability.  While it shouldn't cause any problems 
whatsoever with your system, there's always the chance that someone may find
a way to blame a system crash or loss of data on software like this...you've
been warned!
