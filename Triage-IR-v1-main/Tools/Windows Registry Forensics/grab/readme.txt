This directory contains a tool I wrote to use with either an acquired image
mounted with ImDisk, or with F-Response.  This tool can be run to automate the
collection of files from a system or image, as part of incident response or
triage activities.

To see how to run this tool, simply navigate to the directory at the command
prompt and type "grab"; the syntax information will be displayed.

As with the other tools, be sure that you keep the p2x588.dll file in the
same directory as the EXE file.

This software is released AS-IS, with no statements or guarantees as to 
its effectiveness or stability.  While it shouldn't cause any problems 
whatsoever with your system, there's always the chance that someone may find
a way to blame a system crash or loss of data on software like this...you've
been warned!
