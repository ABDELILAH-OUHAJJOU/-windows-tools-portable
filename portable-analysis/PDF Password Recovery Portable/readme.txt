Unlock PDF documents and remove editing, printing and copying restrictions instantly. Open encrypted and password-protected PDF documents quickly and efficiently. The unique, patent-pending Thunder Tables technology guarantees the recovery of 40-bit keys in under a minute! The multi-threaded low-level code is optimized for modern multi-core PCs, ensuring the best performance and the quickest recovery of the most complex passwords. Removing JScript code, form fields and digital signatures is also an option.


= Requirements and limitations =

- Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008
- about 6 megabytes of free space on hard disk (4 gigabytes for Enterprise version; 4Gb USB flash drive recommended)

The program can process files encrypted with standard encryption handler only. The documents protected with any other encryption handlers (like FileOpen, SASS_INTERNET_STDS from Standards Australia Software Services, or SoftLock's Acrobat Security Plug-Ins) cannot be decrypted.

Please also note that "key search" attack is not applicable to PDF files with 128- and 256-bit encryption.
