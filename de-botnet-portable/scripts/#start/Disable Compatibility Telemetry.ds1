ID=Disable Compatibility Telemetry
Ver=1.0
Desc=The Windows Compatibility Telemetry process is periodically collecting a variety of technical data about your computer and its performance and sending it to Microsoft for its Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program. It is enabled by default, and the data points are useful for Microsoft to improve Windows 10.\nThe CompatTelRunner.exe file is also used to upgrade your system to the latest OS version and install the latest updates.\n\nThe process is not generally required for the Windows operating system to run properly and can be stopped or deleted. This script will disable the CompatTelRunner.exe (Compatibility Telemetry process) in a more cleaner way using Image File Execution Options Debugger Value. Setting this value to an executable designed to kill processes disables it. Windows won't re-enable it with almost each update. This task is also included in the script "Remove Telemetry (Advanced)".
