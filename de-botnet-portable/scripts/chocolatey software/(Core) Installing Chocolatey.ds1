Ver=1.1
Desc=Before you can install any packages with Chocolatey, you first have to install the Chocolatey .exe file and add the "choco" command to the PATH environmental variable.\n\nThis script will install both the Chocolatey .exe file and add the choco command to your PATH variable. Next to this it will set the parameter -allowGlobalConfirmation, which will always install or update without confirmation prompts.\n\nThis script must be executed as administrator.\nChocolatey package Installations should also be executed with elevated rights.\n\nAfter Chocolatey is installed, you'll need to create packages for the software you want to install. Some scripts are included and you can use these as a template to create your own packages and install additional software.
