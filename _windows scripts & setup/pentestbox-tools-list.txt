Nmap - Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

It differs from brute force hash crackers.A brute force hash cracker generate all possible plaintexts and compute the corresponding hashes on the fly, then compare the hashes with the hash to be cracked. Once a match is found, the plaintext is found. If all possible plaintexts are tested and no match is found, the plaintext is not found. With this type of hash cracking, all intermediate computation results are discarded.

Origami - Origami is a Ruby framework for manipulating PDF documents. It features a PDF compliant parser and allows to analyze, modify or create malicious PDF files. Although it may be use for multiple purposes, Origami is primarily intended as a security tool. As such, it does not focus on the graphics contents of a document and does not include a PDF renderer.

PeePDF - peepdf is a Python tool to explore PDF files in order to find out if the file can be harmful or not.

With peepdf it’s possible to see all the objects in the document showing the suspicious elements, supports the most used filters and encodings, it can parse different versions of a file, object streams and encrypted files.

Wireless Attacks

    Aircrack-ng -Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.

Text Editors

To make PenetestBox more awesome, I have added Atom and vim as its text editors. After opening Atom it will spilt up the screen with Atom on one side and your terminal on the other side, while vim runs on the same tab. Atom splitting is done to make reporting much more easier by giving access to console and editor on same screen.

Linux Utilities

PentestBox provides nearly all Linux utilities in an Windows Environment. Below are the list of the Linux utilities which are inside PentestBox
antiword, basename, bash, bison, bzip2, cat, chmod, cmp, connect, cp, curl, cut, date, diff, dirname, du, env, expr, false, find, flex, gawk, git, grep, gunzip, gzip, head, id, kill, mkdir, md5sum, ls, ln , mv, openssl, patch, ps, rebase, rm, rmdir, scp, sh, ssh-keygen, touch, tr, true, uname, uniq, unzip, wc, xargs

Also to make PentestBox more awesome we have also included HTTPie, HTTPie is a command line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.
Browser

PentestBox also contains a modified version of Mozilla Firefox with all the security addons pre installed in it. To see all the addons which are pre installed in it, click here
