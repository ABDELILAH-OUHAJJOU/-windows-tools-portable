HijackThis Fork Portable
Folder: hijackthis-portable
Binary Name: HijackThisPortable.exe
Description: HijackThis scans your computer's browser and operating system settings to generate a log file of the current state. You can selectively remove unwanted settings and files from your computer. Because the settings identified in a HijackThis log file can belong to both legitimate software and unwanted malware, it is important to use extreme caution when choosing to remove anything using HijackThis. HijackThis also comes with a process manager, HOSTS file editor, and alternate data stream scanner. HijackThis Fork is a continuation of the originally discontinued HijackThis tool.
