The Receiving Party will only use Confidential Information in accordance with the Contract and disclose Confidential Information to any third party only as required to fulfil or comply with its obligations under this Contract and only if the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations which are at least as protective to the Receiving Party as those set forth in this Confidentiality section.

A.4. Data protection

TeamViewer complies with applicable data protection law. TeamViewer collects, processes and uses personal data of Customer in its function as a data controller as set out and in accordance with the relevant Product Privacy Policies available for download under https://www.teamviewer.com/en/privacy-policy. Additionally, TeamViewer may act as a processor for Customer’s personal data as set out and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Data Processing Agreement (DPA) provided separately under this link. The DPA does not apply if Customer is a natural person using the Software or the Services in the course of a purely personal or family activity (cf. Art. 2(2)(c) EU General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”).

A.5. Non-personal data

TeamViewer may process non-personal or anonymous data to improve functionality and the Customers’ experience with the Products, including the Software and the Services. Customer agrees that TeamViewer owns all rights in and is free to use any such non-personal or anonymous data in any way it deems fit for development, diagnostic, corrective as well as marketing or any other purposes.

A.6. Changes to the EULA

TeamViewer shall be entitled to amend this EULA upon no less than twenty-eight (28) days prior notice to Customer. Unless Customer notifies TeamViewer in writing of its objection to such amendment within fifteen (15) days of such notice, then the amendment shall be deemed accepted by Customer. If, on the other hand, Customer notifies TeamViewer in writing of its objection to such amendment within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of notice the Contract shall be continued under the existing terms without giving effect to such amendment.

A.7. No deviating provisions

The Contract contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all proposals, understandings, representations, warranties, covenants, and any other communications (whether written or oral) between the parties relating thereto and is binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns. Any inconsistent or conflicting terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or similar instrument of Customer shall be of no force or effect, unless TeamViewer has explicitly approved such terms and conditions in writing. This requirement of explicit written form approval applies in particular to Customer’s terms and conditions, regardless of whether TeamViewer provides Software or Services to the Customer in knowledge of the Customer’s general terms and conditions without explicitly objecting to them.

A.8. Warranties; no guarantees

Warranties in this EULA refer to the description of remedies available to Customer in case of non-performance or defective performance and shall not be construed as a guarantee that stands for strict liability without fault. A guarantee of TeamViewer for quality or committed features in the meaning of preceding clause shall only be taken as such if made by TeamViewer in writing (including a signature) and labelled expressively as “guarantee”.

A.9. Severability; waiver

If any provision of the Contract is found partly or wholly invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and remaining provisions of the Contract shall remain in full force and effect. A waiver of any breach or default under the Contract shall not constitute a waiver of any other subsequent breach or default.

A.10. Communication via email

Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, any notifications and declarations in connection with the Contract may also be made by email. To this end, TeamViewer may use the email address the Customer provided upon registration or in the TeamViewer account. The Customer shall be responsible for checking its emails regularly and, if necessary, updating its email address. TeamViewer’s contact information is available under this link: https://www.teamviewer.com/en/support/contact/.

A.11. Documentation

User manuals are retrievable online in German and English under https://www.teamviewer.com/en/documents/. Any further languages may be offered by TeamViewer at its sole discretion. As between the parties, TeamViewer retains all right, title and interest in and to such documentation and in all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof including, without limitation, all rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, know-how, trademark and other proprietary or intellectual property rights.

B. Software Specific Terms

The Software Specific Terms contain the terms and conditions that additionally apply to the use of: (i) certain software provided by TeamViewer, whether installed on devices of the Customer or accessed via web browser, also including any applications (e. g. apps for mobile terminals), addon components, customized settings and features, and all updates and Release Versions as hereinbelow defined thereof (collectively “Software”), and (ii) servers for the establishment of encrypted connections (handshake) and for the forwarding of data packets (routing) in connection with the use of the Software (“Server Services”), as well as (iii) any further cloud-based services provided by TeamViewer. The Software, Server Services and other cloud-based services provided by TeamViewer are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Services”.

B.1. Licenses

B.1.1 Subscription and Free License

For the use of Software and Server Services, Customer shall acquire the right of use (“License”) respectively as:

-   i. a temporary, i.e., term- or subscription-based, license against recurring payments (“Subscription”); or

-   B.1.1.1 Subscription

    Licenses for Subscription are exclusively available to entrepreneurs and not provided to consumers. Entrepreneur in the preceding sentence means a natural or legal person, or a partnership with legal personality, that acts in exercise of trade, business or profession while entering the Contract.

    B.1.1.2 Free Version

    TeamViewer may provide a free-of-charge version for selected Software products to Customer solely for the personal and non-commercial purposes (“Free Version”). The use for the exercise of Customer’s trade, business or profession, or the use for the purposes for which Customer directly or indirectly receives compensation (e. g. teamwork with colleagues, free support provided to third parties which have bought Customer’s own software or other product), shall not be qualified as personal.

    B.1.1.3 Test period

    If the Contract provides for a test period, Customer may terminate the Contract within seven (7) calendar days of the conclusion of the Contract. In such a case, Customer shall be provided with a refund of any prepaid, unused fees (if any) paid to TeamViewer for the applicable Software that is subject to the test period.

    B.1.1.4 Trial Use

    Prior to entering into a Contract for Subscription, TeamViewer may offer to Customer the opportunity for a trial use for the Software and the Server Services during a defined trial use period (“Trial Use”).

For any Trial Use, this EULA shall also apply.

B.1.2 Scope of License

The License is granted to Customer herein as non-exclusive, worldwide (subject to applicable export control regulations; unless Customer is expressly granted a limited right to use the Service only in a specific territory in the Contract), non-transferrable and not sub-licensable, and limited to the right to install, run and use the Software on Customer’s own devices, or any devices in the immediate possession of Customer, for the purpose of operating its own business activities and within the limits of the scope of use specified in the Contract.

The rights of use granted under the Contract for Subscription shall be limited in time to the specified term of Subscription and end with the expiry or termination thereof.

B.1.3 Authorized Users

Customer may only provide use of its acquired License to the Authorized Users. “Authorized User” means: (i) if Customer is an individual, solely Customer; (ii) if Customer is a legal entity, any current employees, agents, representatives or temporary workers authorized by Customer to use the Software or Services solely for the support of Customer’s internal business, provided that such access and use shall be limited to their provision of services to Customer in scope of their employment or assignment; (iii) in any other cases subject to written consent by TeamViewer.

Customer is responsible for the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users, as well as any other person that accesses and uses the Software and Service by using the access credentials provided by Customer, as its own acts and omissions. All obligations of Customer under this EULA and the respective Contract shall apply fully to any such Authorized Users or other persons as if they were Customers hereunder.

B.1.4 Overuse by Quantity

The usable licensed units included in the scope of license acquired by Customer, in particular regarding the amounts of licensed users or agents, managed devices, experts and annually allowed reassignments, etc., shall be specified in the Contract; where the Contract does not contain a specification, the usable licensed units available under the respective license type as stated in the Product Description shall apply. If Customer exceeds the quantity of licensed units during the term of Contract, additional license fees will be charged for the excess at the then current list price of TeamViewer or, at the election of TeamViewer, pro rata relating to the price provided in the Contract.

B.1.5 Prohibited use

Any use of Software and/or Server Services that is not expressly granted is prohibited. In particular, Customer shall not, or allow a third party to: (i) attempt to circumvent any technical devices of the Software that are directed at, or have the effect of, enforcing the terms of the EULA; (ii) modify, create derivative works, translate, decompile or create or attempt to create, by reverse engineering or otherwise, the source code or the object code of the Software; (iii) use the Software under any circumstance whatsoever directly or indirectly in a computer service business or service bureau or in a rental or commercial timesharing arrangement or as a spyware; (iv) remove, modify or obscure any copyright, trade secret, confidentiality, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights, serial number, notice, legend or similar on any copy of the Software, or related data, manuals, documentation or other materials; (v) market, sell, lend, rent, lease, or otherwise distribute, the Softwareor provide access to Services to third parties; or (vi) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any rights in or to the Software. This shall not affect Customer’s mandatory statutory rights.

B.1.6 Reservation of rights

As between the parties, TeamViewer retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any customization and Release Versions) and in all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Software including, without limitation, all rights to patent, copyright, trade secret, know-how, trademark and other proprietary or intellectual property rights, even if provided or otherwise contributed to by the Customer.

B.1.7 Source code

The rights of use granted shall not include any rights to the source code of the Software.

B.1.8 Usage analyses, right to audit and self-declaration

TeamViewer may analyze Customer’s use of the Software and/or Services for security reasons as well as for product improvement, license auditing and/or marketing purposes. To that end, TeamViewer may use, at its sole discretion, and implement technical measures regarding the functionality of the Software and the Server Services to assess whether Customer’s usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage volume and thus with the chosen license type, and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by Customer. TeamViewer may require Customer, at any time, to provide a self-declaration regarding its actual scope of use and/or usage pattern.

B.2. Services

B.2.1 Product Specification

The functions and features of the Software and Server Services are set forth, respectively, in these Software Specific Terms, in the Product Specific Terms and/or, as the case may be, in an annex to the respective Contract (in each case, a “Product Specification”).

B.2.2 Product Specification for Free Version

A key element of and part of the Product Specification for the Free Version is the display and receipt of personalized marketing messages in the Software as well as the processing of personal data necessary to provide such personalization. In this context, the Free Version also requires cookies, including in certain cases third-party cookies, to be placed on a Customer’s devices, which enable TeamViewer and third-party recipients to analyze the Customer’s usage as well as online usage behavior. Detailed information on the purposes and exact implementation of personalization processes are described in TeamViewer’s Privacy and Cookie Policies.

B.2.3 System Requirement

Customer is responsible for providing the system environment required for the use of respective Software in accordance with the system requirements set forth in the Product Specific Terms (“System Requirement”).

B.2.4 Provision, installation and configuration of Software

Depending on the software types, Software may be provided for electronic download or made accessible via web browser. Customer shall be solely responsible for the download, installation and configuration of the Software. Customized adjustment, development, integration with Customer´s system or external software, training of Customer´s staff, as well as any additional consulting or support services other than warranty claims provided hereunder, are not included in the scope of Services and shall be subject to express written agreement.

B.2.5 Server Services

For the establishment of encrypted remote communication connections between different users of the Software, the Software must communicate with servers of TeamViewer (so-called “handshake”). In addition, it may be necessary for the transmission of data in the context of a session (e. g. online meeting or remote maintenance) that encrypted data packets be forwarded by servers of TeamViewer (so-called “routing”). Such handshake and routing are made available in connection with TeamViewer’s Server Services.

TeamViewer provides Customer with the Server Services subject to the conditions set out in this EULA. Customer acknowledges that the Server Services may be unavailable or include latency from time to time due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer. Additionally, Customer acknowledges that the end-to-end connection between different users of the Software is dependent on Customer’s internet connection to the data center as well as Customer’s use of hardware and software (e. g. PC, operating system) in compliance with System Requirements for the Software, all of which shall not be included in the services provided by TeamViewer and shall be Customer’s responsibility at its own costs.

In case of Free Version, Customer has no claim to demand the provision of the Server Services and TeamViewer may in its sole discretion discontinue or modify the Server Services at any time.

B.2.6 TeamViewer account

TeamViewer may require Customer (and its Authorized Users) to sign up for a TeamViewer account and being logged in to the TeamViewer account to be able to use the Services. TeamViewer may further set certain account verification requirements that Customer will be required to meet to use the Services.

B.2.7 Telephone conference number

If, in the context of its Services, TeamViewer provides a telephone conference number for dialing in as an alternative to the audio conference function of the Software, the provider of the respective telecommunication service (and not TeamViewer) shall be solely responsible for the telephone connection of the respective number. The use of the telephone conference number may be subject to a separate fee charged by the respective provider.

B.2.8 Programming interfaces

At TeamViewer’s discretion, it may provide use of programming interfaces or other software interfaces (“API”) which may enable applications of third parties or of Customer (collectively “Third-party Software”) to communicate with the Software or the servers provided by TeamViewer as part of the Server Services. TeamViewer, in its sole discretion, may change or switch off APIs at any time without any obligation or liability to Customer. The respective provider shall be responsible for the Third-party Software. The provisions of the Contract shall not apply to any such Third-party Software and TeamViewer is under no obligation to test, validate or otherwise review Third-party Software, and shall have no liability for any Third-party Software or in connection with the use thereof.

B.2.9 Changes to the Services

Some features and functions of the Software or Server Services provided by TeamViewer may include or depend on certain third-party components which may be subject to changes by such third parties. TeamViewer is entitled to modify or limit such features and functions, provided this does not materially interfere with the substantial functions of Services.

TeamViewer reserves the right to change the Software in the context of updates and/or Release Versions as well as the Server Services (including the System Requirements) for good cause. Such good cause exists especially if the change is required due to (i) a necessary adaptation required by applicable law, regulation, court order, or order of authority; (ii) changes to applicable technical framework conditions (e.g., new encryption standards); or (iii) the protection of system security.

B.2.10 Release Versions

TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, provide releases of the Software for download (“Release Versions”). Additional features to the Software which are separately marketed and/or priced by TeamViewer (“Additional Features”) shall not qualify as Release Versions. All rights of use set forth in the Contract applicable to the Software shall also apply to Release Versions.

Customer is obliged to update the Software with any Release Version at its own cost as soon as reasonably practicable. Customer’s systems shall comply with the System Requirements to accommodate new Release Versions. Any malfunctioning of the Software or failure in the Services that is attributable to non-compliance with this section shall be Customer’s sole responsibility.

The obligation of Customer holding a previously acquired perpetual license to update the Software shall be limited to the minor Release Versions (e.g., version XX.1, XX.2 “Minor Release Version”) relating to the main version (e.g., version XX, YY) for which the Perpetual License was acquired. Minor Release Versions may contain the correction of errors, security patches as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g., optimizations in the program execution speed) and will be marked by TeamViewer – in its sole discretion – by a change in the number behind the main version number.

B.2.11 Software Lifecycle Policy

Use of the Software shall be subject to TeamViewer’s Software Lifecycle Policy available for download under this link: https://dl.teamviewer.com/docs/en/TeamViewer-Software-Lifecycle-Policy-en.pdf

B.3. Customer Obligations

B.3.1 Lawful Use

Customer shall use the Software and the Server Services only in accordance with the provisions of the Contract and in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to such use, in particular all applicable data protection and export control provisions and shall not infringe any third-party rights in connection with such use.

B.3.2 Export controls and economic sanctions

Customer acknowledges that the Software and related technical data as well as the Services (collectively “Controlled Technology”) are subject to the import and export control and economic sanctions laws of Germany, the European Union and the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all relevant laws and will not export, re-export, or transfer any Controlled Technology in contravention of German, EU or U.S. law nor to any restricted country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. Customer further agrees that it will not export, transfer, or sell any Controlled Technology for use in connection with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, or missiles, drones or space launch vehicles capable of delivering such weapons.

Customer represents that it is not (i) a Restricted Party (as defined below); (ii) currently engaging in any transaction, activity or conduct that could result in a violation of applicable Sanctions (as defined below) and warrants that it will not make available the Controlled Technology directly or indirectly, to, or for the benefit of, any Restricted Party.

This section shall only apply to Customer to the extent that the provisions herein would not result in (i) any violation of, conflict with or liability under EU Regulation (EC) 2271/1996 or (ii) a violation or conflict with section 7 German Foreign Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) or a similar antiboycott statute.

“Restricted Party” means any person (i) designated on any Sanctions List, (ii) that is, or is part of, a governmental authority of a Sanctioned Territory, (iii) owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, any of the foregoing, (iv) located, organized, or resident in, or operating from, a Sanctioned Territory, or (v) otherwise targeted under any Sanctions.

“Sanctioned Territory” means any country or other territory subject to a general export, import, financial or investment embargo under Sanctions.

“Sanctions” means economic or financial sanctions or trade embargoes or other comprehensive prohibitions against transaction activity pursuant to anti-terrorism laws or export control laws imposed, administered or enforced from time to time by the US, EU, UN, Germany, or any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.

B.4. Limitation of Warranty

B.4.1 Limited warranty for Subscription

TeamViewer shall, subject to this section B (Server Services), maintain Software and Server Services substantially in accordance with the applicable Product Description using commercially reasonable care and skills during the term of Subscription.

B.4.2 Maintenance

The maintenance by TeamViewer set out herein does not include (i) any adaptation of the Software to new operating systems or new operating system versions, (ii) adaptation of the Software to the scope of functions of competing products, (iii) establishment of compatibility with new data formats or Release Versions or (iv) provision of any functionality which is no longer supported by TeamViewer.

B.4.3 Error elimination

Customer may report any Errors in the Services preferably via the web portal provided by TeamViewer under the link https://www.teamviewer.com/en/support/. “Error” means any defect or malfunction that causes (i) the Software or Server Services to fail to perform the substantial functionality and/or expressly committed features in the respective Subscription, or (ii) the use of the Services by Customer to be unavailable or impaired in material aspects. Minor or immaterial deviations from the agreed or assumed characteristics or just slight impairment of use shall not be deemed as Errors.

TeamViewer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate Errors within a reasonable period of time following Customer’s notification of such Errors, for which Customer shall provide comprehensive details of the circumstances relating to the Errors and supporting documentation (e.g., screenshots, protocol data) in its notification, as far as this is possible and can be reasonably expected. TeamViewer may, at its sole option, eliminate Errors by delivering patches or updates, through Release Versions or otherwise. If the elimination of an Error is not available using financially reasonable efforts within a predictable time, TeamViewer shall be entitled to provide temporary workarounds for such Error, provided that the functionalities and availability of the Services are not materially affected.

B.4.4 Infringement of third party right

If Software infringes a third party’s patent or copyright, TeamViewer will, at its sole discretion: (i) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Software; or (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it no longer infringes the relevant intellectual property right. If neither of the remedies in (i) or (ii) are reasonably available, either Party shall have the right to terminate the Contract with immediate effect.

B.4.5 Claims for damages

Any potential claims for damages based on a breach of warranty or defective performance shall be subject to the limitation of liability stipulated in the Jurisdiction Specific Terms.

B.4.6 No warranty for Free License

Software and Server Services under Free License are provided as-is. TeamViewer assumes therefore no maintenance obligations and no warranty in relation to Customer holding a Free License, except in the case of fraudulent concealment of defect.

B.4.7 Limitation period

Customer´s remedies and claims for defects shall expire twelve (12) months after the circumstances giving rise to the claim have been discovered by Customer or, in the event of ignorance, twelve (12) months after Customer should reasonably have been aware of them. This shall not apply to the case of fraudulent concealment of defect, or a guarantee period expressly granted by TeamViewer for a longer period.

B.5. Term and Termination

B.5.1 Term, auto-renewal and ordinary termination of Subscription

Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the initial term of the Contract for Subscription shall be twelve (12) months (“Initial Term”) and automatically renewed for subsequent periods of twelve (12) months (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either party notifies the other party no less than twenty-eight (28) calendar days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term that the Contract shall not renew. Ordinary termination rights are excluded during the Initial or Renewal Term.

B.5.2 Term and ordinary termination of Free Version

Unless otherwise specified, the Contract for Free Version shall be concluded for an unlimited period of time. Either party may terminate the Contract at any time.

The continued use of Free Version by Customer shall be deemed as acceptance of the terms of this EULA (including without limitation to the Product Specification of Free Versions) and continuation of the Contract thereunder. This shall also apply if Customer indicates disagreement with the EULA by any act or declaration but still uses the Free Version thereafter.

B.5.3 Extraordinary termination

TeamViewer shall be entitled to extraordinarily terminate the Contract for breach in case of sections B.1.5 (Prohibited use), B.3.1 (Lawful use), B.3.2 (Export controls and economic sanctions), A.4 (Data protection), A.2.6 (Late payment). To the extent a DPA is required in accordance with section A.4, lack of such DPA or termination thereof shall also constitute cause for termination of the Contract. Either party’s right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected.

Notwithstanding the above, termination by the Customer based on non-performance of service in conformity with the Contract shall only be admissible if TeamViewer had been given enough opportunities to eliminate the error/shortcoming and has failed to do so or the subsequent performance was unsuccessful.

TeamViewer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate Errors within a reasonable period of time following Customer’s notification of such Errors, for which Customer shall provide comprehensive details of the circumstances relating to the Errors and supporting documentation (e.g., screenshots, protocol data) in its notification, as far as this is possible and can be reasonably expected. TeamViewer may, at its sole option, eliminate Errors by delivering patches or updates, through Release Versions or otherwise. If the elimination of an Error is not available using financially reasonable efforts within a predictable time, TeamViewer shall be entitled to provide temporary workarounds for such Error, provided that the functionalities and availability of the Services are not materially affected.

The provisions of this DPA and the EULA concluded at the same time complement each other and exist side by side. In the event of any contradictions in the area of data protection, the DPA shall take precedence over the provisions of the EULA.

    To the extent this DPA is applicable, TeamViewer shall only process personal data within the scope of this DPA and on documented instructions of the Customer, which are mutually agreed upon by the parties in the EULA and especially defined by the Product functionality, unless TeamViewer is required to do so by Union or the member state law to which TeamViewer is subject; in such a case TeamViewer shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless the respective law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest. The Customer can give additional written instructions as far as this is necessary to comply with the applicable data protection law. The documentation on issued instructions shall be kept by the Customer for the term of the DPA.

-   2.3. Obligation of confidentiality

    -   2.4.2. Scope
        For the specific commissioned processing of personal data, a level of security appropriate to the risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural persons affected by the processing shall be guaranteed. To this end, the protection objectives of Art. 32 (1) GDPR, such as confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and services and their resilience in terms of the nature, scope, as well as context of the processing shall be taken into account in such a way that the risks are mitigated permanently by appropriate Security Measures.
    -   2.4.3. Security Measures
