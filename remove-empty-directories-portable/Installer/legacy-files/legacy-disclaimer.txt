# Archived legacy disclaimer

## Remark from 2021

No more cases where reported since about ten years, so I removed this disclaimer from the main license and info files. 
Keeping this file is for historic reasons.

## Original message

To be honest with you as user of RED I have to tell you that one user of RED 
(v2.1) reported that it deleted folders which were not completely empty and 
contained files important to him. I'm really very sorry for that! I checked all
routines of RED several times to ensure nothing goes wrong, but somehow it 
happened on the system of that user. Unfortunately, I could not determine what
caused that behaviour. In addition to that the user did not wanted to try to
locate the error, because he was (understandably) very upset and uninstalled RED 
instantly. But he told me that the directory names contained chinese characters. 
So I tried to reproduce the error by testing RED with foreign directory names. 
But I could not find a bug - RED worked as expected.

My conclusion: I currently assume it was a unfortunate exception or some sort
of misconfiguration and I hope that it does not happen again. I also refactored
and optimized the whole sourcecode of RED 2.2 to improve the stability and the
error handling.

To sum up, if you use RED for the first time have a look at the directories 
RED found and rethink if they are plausible. And if you want to be really 
safe double-click a few folders to see if they are really empty. This 
especially applies to systems with directory names containing any special 
characters. Contact me if you notice anything strange.

BTW: As I originally developed RED for myself therefore I took particular 
care to ensure everything works correctly.
