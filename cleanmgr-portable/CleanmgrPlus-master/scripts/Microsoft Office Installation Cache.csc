Title=Microsoft Office Installation Cache*
Description=If you have Microsoft Office installed, you most likely have a hidden folder on your C: drive called MSOCache. This is used to facilitate repairs and reinstallations of Microsoft Office features but it can eat up a lot of disk space. When you are on a crash diet you might have to live without it. It won't affect running any Office applications, but attempts to install new features will fail.
